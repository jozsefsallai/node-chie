# Chie

Powerful TSC decryption/encryption tool for Node.js and the CLI.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jozsefsallai/node-chie.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jozsefsallai/node-chie) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/jozsefsallai/node-chie/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/jozsefsallai/node-chie?branch=master) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/node-chie.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-chie)

## Getting Started

Install using Yarn

```sh
yarn add node-chie
```

or npm:

```sh
npm i node-chie
```

Import and have fun!

```js
const { TSC } = require('node-chie');

TSC().fromFile('input.tsc').decrypt().toFile('output.txt');
```

## Usage

Chie supports the following methods:

  * **fromFile(path)** - Read data from file
  * **fromString(str)** - Read data from string
  * **decrypt()** - Convert TSC to plaintext
  * **encrypt()** - Convert plaintext to TSC
  * **toString()** - Return the output as a string
  * **toFile(path)** - Write the output to a file

## CLI

Chie is also available for the command line.

```sh
npm i -g node-chie
```

You will have access to two new commands: `decrypt-tsc` and `encrypt-tsc`. Running either of these will display a prompt asking you for the source and destination paths.

## Examples

The Github repository contains examples for real-world applications in which Chie's TSC decryption/encryption capabilities can be used. To run any of the examples, you can copy the code into a JS file, install `chie` (and other dependencies, if required), and run `node index.js`.

### Example 1: Flag ID checker

**Code: https://github.com/jozsefsallai/node-chie/blob/master/examples/flagcheck/index.js**

This script can help you identify where exactly a given flag ID is used in all of the TSC files. This can be useful for modding where it's important not to  use conflicting flag IDs. It will tell you which files contain an assignment of the specified flag (`<FL+`) in which events.

### Example 2: Huzzahify for Cave Story+

**Code: https://github.com/jozsefsallai/node-chie/blob/master/examples/huzzahify/index.js**

This script will make Balrog say "Huzzah!" instead of "Oh Yeaaah!!" in Cave Story+. It looks through all TSC files and replaces each occurrence of Nicalis' translation of Balrog's catchphrase to the fanmade one. This WILL overwrite your TSC files so make sure you back them up before running the script.
